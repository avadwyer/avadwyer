Ava (she/her)
Tewksbury, MA with my parents, dog, and cat.
I have completed a two week python coding camp and infrequently worked with python in my own time.
I hope to effortlessly code in any language by the end of this course.
I don't have any concerns for the course.
I am most excited for winter and spring formals.
